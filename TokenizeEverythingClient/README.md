#### Tokenize Everything Client

You need to make sure that inside the `src` folder, there is a contracts folder. If it is not there, please copy it from `build` folder in the project home folder which appears after `truffle compile` or you can create sym-link from inside the `src/` like this `ln -s ../../build/contracts/ contracts`  

After that, pretty much all you have to do is run `npm install` and `npm start`.  

Thanks!
